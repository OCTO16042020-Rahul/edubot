To develop an automatic and efficient web based edubot system which is a valuable tool for improving ELearning and Education. Here we employ natural language processing technology to understand
questions given in natural language text as English. Our system will detect the type of question, based
on which proper technique for extracting the answer is used. The system returns only blocks or phrases
of data containing the answer rather than full documents. Using this system, the student or learner can
extract the exact answer to a particular question rather than obtaining numerous results which are
irrelevant. The aim of developing this system is to provide E-learning facility to students or learners
from each and every corner of the globe, especially those who are not able to access classroom
learning. This system is convenient and time saving for the students who can get correct answers to
their questions as well as tutors who need not waste time to reply to each and every question
individually. It is cost effective too
